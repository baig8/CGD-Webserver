## About Project:
Cancer is a disease which takes lives of many people each year, but
some times false positive leads to unneccessary surgeries
which lead to pain and trouble for many patients.
We take a dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is **benign** or **malignant**. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for woman. 

For building the project we have used Wisconsin Breast cancer data which has 569 rows of which 357 are benign and 212 are malignant. 
The data is prepossessed and scaled. We have trained both ANN and SVM and SVM gives best accuracy of 98.2%. To provide the easy to
use interface to doctors we have developed a website that will take the data and display the output with accuracy and time taken 
to predict.


## Languages or Frameworks Used 

  * Python: language
  * NumPy: library for numerical calculations
  * Pandas: library for data manipulation and analysis
  * SkLearn: library which features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms
  * Flask: microframework for building web applications using Python.
